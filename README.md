# advent-of-code-2022

Choose js or ts for this year's Advent of Code!

## How to start

- Choose a language and work within that directory
- Run `yarn` to install necessary dependencies
- Run `yarn aoc` + the day you want to run. Example: `yarn aoc 15` runs day 15
- Running `yarn aoc` without a day will run all days of the challenge in series.

### MOST IMPORTANT STEP
Have fun and learn something new :)
